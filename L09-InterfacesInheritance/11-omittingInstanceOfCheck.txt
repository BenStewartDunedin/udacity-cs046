If the instanceof check is removed from scene.java e.g.

            for (Drawable d : elements)
            {  
//                if (d instanceof Moveable)
  //              {
                    Moveable m = (Moveable) d;
                    m.move(1);
    //            }
            }

RESULT:
There is a run time error (note: not compile error) because some drawables cannot be cast to Moveables i.e.

java.lang.ClassCastException:
House cannot be case to Moveable
