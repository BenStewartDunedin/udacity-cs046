Course Assessment Part 8 (Intro to Java Programming)

===============================

31. Loops

Question: Come up with a situation in which you would want to use a for loops.
Why would a while loop not work as well for this case?

Answer: I would use a for loop when I know how many loops to iterate
e.g. for i = 0; i < 24; i++
e.g. one for each hour of the day

Question: Now describe a scenario in which a while loop would work better
than a for loop. What makes a while loop more suitable this time?

Answer: I use a while loop when the number of loops in unknown beforehand
e.g. while (electricty_on == false)
e.g. while the switch is off.
